# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As I'm the only developer on this project, my ability to support legacy versions is limited, so I am only able to support the latest released version.
That said, this package is for development only and has no use when ran on any machine other than the developers own local environment so security issues are minimal.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 3.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you spot a vulnerability, take a look at the issues log and if it's not already there, add an issue. There is no real 'process' or format to adhere to, just make sure your issue is clear.
